Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

xsgen depends on `PyNE <http://www.pyne.io>`_. You can find installation
instructions for PyNE `here <http://pyne.io/install.html>`_.

To install from source, simply download the source code from the
official GitHub repo and run ``setup.py``::

    git clone git://github.com/bright-dev/xsgen.git
    cd xsgen/
    python setup.py install --user

Currently, we require `OpenMC <http://mit-crpg.github.io/openmc/>`_
and `ORIGEN 2.2 <https://rsicc.ornl.gov/CustomerService.aspx>`_ for
burnup and criticality computations. Installation instructions, along
with a wealth of documentation, for OpenMC can be found `here
<http://mit-crpg.github.io/openmc/quickinstall.html>`_. ORIGEN 2.2 is
distributed by RSICC at the above link.
