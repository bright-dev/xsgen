Welcome to xsgen's documentation!
=================================

xsgen is a tool for computing multi-group neutron cross-section, burnup, and
multiplication factor (k\ :sub:`inf`\ ) as a function of reactor state, which
includes time/fluence, material properties, and reactor geometry.

We use a plugin-based system to allow a flexible approach with respect to
underlying physics engines.

The source code can be found
